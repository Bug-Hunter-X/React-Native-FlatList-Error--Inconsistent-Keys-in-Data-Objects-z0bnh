# React Native FlatList Inconsistent Keys Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but easily missed bug in React Native's `FlatList` component. The bug arises when the data objects being rendered have inconsistent keys.  This often leads to cryptic error messages that are difficult to trace.

## Bug Description
When rendering data with `FlatList`, ensure your data objects maintain consistent keys.  If keys are inconsistent, `FlatList`'s performance optimizations will fail, possibly resulting in unexpected errors or rendering issues.

## Solution
The solution involves standardizing the keys in your data objects. Ensure all objects have the same keys with consistent data types.
